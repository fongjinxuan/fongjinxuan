<h1>Course Reflection</h1>
<p>    From this course, I had a grasp on foundations and important concepts of digital electronics. The lectures given were interesting and informative.</p>

<p>Throughout the course, several lab sessions were held to strengthen our understandings of modules taught in lectures. The sessions were fun and I grew more interest towards the systems between the lab sessions. In Lab 1 and Lab 3, we grouped up with coursemates to have hands-on experience connecting logic circuits and build a counter. We tried Deeds, a software used to build demo of logic circuit in Lab 2. We also had a final project to design a data transferer based on the knowledges learnt in the course, which I think gives us oppurtunity to learn more about the logic circuits.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the course gave me motivations to learn further in digital electronics. I am looking forward to have courses that are related to this field.</p>
