<h1>Course Reflection</h1>
<p>    From this course, I have the basic understandings on theories and problem solving techniques in programming. I also learnt the fundamentals of C++ programming language which helps me a lot to understand further knowledges related to programming techniques. Hands-on practices are also given by lecturer during lectures to strengthen our understanding, which enable me to evaluate my practical skills as well.</p>

<p>Besides, I had chances to collaborate with my coursemate to solve assignments given by lecturer, which develops my soft skills such as communication skills. In Assignment 1, I had a deeper understanding in problem solving techniques and how algorithm works in computer science. In Assignment 2 and Assignment 3, I worked with my teammate and we had a deeper understanding in C++ programming languages. </p>

<p>In conclusion, the course is extremely helpful for a newbie in programming like me to learn related knowledge. This motivates me and gains more interest in programming.</p>
