<h1>Course Reflection</h1>
<p>From the course, I learnt the fundamentals of information systems and technology. The lectures given by lecturer are informative and easy to understand, while the slides used in lectures are simple and clear.</p>

<p>In the course, we had several assignments based on industry talks and visits held and a project that gives us chances to collaborate with coursematees. Assignment 1 and Assignment 3 was related to industry talks, where we get to understand work environmnet in the real world and essential skills in our study field, which is computer science. Assignment 2 was based on industry visit held at UTMDigital, where my coursemates and I were enlightened by the employees in the UTMDigital.</p>

<p>For the final project, my teammates and I had a deep understanding regarding design thinking. We also had improvements in our soft skills such as teamworking and time management skills throughout the process.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the course is fun and informative. I hope that knowledge and skills equipped from this course can be applied in my future studies and careers.</p>
