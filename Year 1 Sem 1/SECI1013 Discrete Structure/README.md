<h1>Course Reflection</h1>
<p>    Throughout the course, I learnt basic discrete structures that could be applied in problem-solving. Topics such as set theory, relations, counting methods, graph theory and finite automata were taught in the course.</p>

<p>Also, I was given the oppurtunity to complete assignments with my coursemates. From the 4 assignments assigned to us, we collaborated smoothly and improved our communication skills between discussions made. The assignments were based on lectures taught that helped us to understand the theories better. </p>

<p>In conclusion, the course was informative and benificial for me to solve real-life problems related to computer science. I hope the knowledges learnt can be applied in my future studies.</p>
